## Radiance

Radiance is attempt to create clone of Geometry Wars (more specifically: Grid Wars 2)
which will be working in web browser.
If time will allow and it will be technically possible I'll try to make it massive multiplayer game.
I'll also try to make graphic as good as possible, however it could be hard to reach
awesomeness of the original using only html canvas.

If you never seen Grid Wars 2 then take a look at those screenshots:

Some very basic demo should be available at the end of first week of November.
